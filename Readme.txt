Overview
This program is designed to analyze and predict real estate prices using a variety of regression models. The dataset used is called the "USA Real Estate Dataset", and it contains a whopping 770,000 columns of real-world data. The provided Python script harnesses the power of machine learning libraries, including Scikit-learn, and graphical user interface (GUI) libraries like Tkinter to achieve its objectives.

Dataset Used:
The "USA Real Estate Dataset" (realtor-data.csv) is leveraged in this code. This dataset presumably contains information about properties in the USA, such as their status, acreage, location, price, and other relevant details. Given its vast size, the dataset might contain valuable insights about the US real estate market.

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
Two subsets of the data are created based on property status: "for_sale" and "ready_to_build".
There is data cleaning involved, like converting comma separators to points for numerical interpretation.
The program also checks for any empty columns and addresses them.
For better visualization and analysis, categorical columns 'city' and 'state' are converted to numerical values. However, mappings are maintained to revert these numerical values to their original names for display purposes.
Some less relevant columns, such as 'full_address', 'sold_date', and 'street', are dropped from the dataset.
Dummy variables are created for the 'status' column, and any missing values are replaced with the column's mean.
The processed data is then split into features (X) and target (y) DataFrames, with 'price' being the target variable.
Model Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

Four regression models are trained on the dataset:

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
The trained Decision Tree's performance metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2), are printed to the console.

Graphics:
A graphical representation of the Decision Tree Regressor is generated using the matplotlib library. This visualization can be displayed in a new window upon clicking a dedicated button in the main GUI.
GUI Overview:
The GUI developed using Tkinter has the following features:

Metrics Display: Displays the MAE, MSE, and R2 for each of the regression models.
Actual vs. Predicted Plots: Scatter plots showcasing the predicted vs. actual values for each regression model.
Prediction Panel: Allows users to input feature values and select a regression model to predict the property price.
Sample Data Display: Shows a sample of the dataset in a table format, translating the encoded city and state values back to their original names.
Decision Tree Visualization Button: Displays the trained Decision Tree in a new window.
Usage:
When users run the program, a GUI window appears, displaying performance metrics for the trained models, actual vs. predicted scatter plots, and an interface to make new price predictions. Users can input property details, select a regression model, and the program will predict the property's price using the selected model. A sample of the dataset is also displayed, helping users understand the data format.

Conclusion:
This program is a comprehensive tool for real estate price prediction and analysis. By leveraging machine learning and an intuitive GUI, users can gain insights into property pricing and the factors affecting it. The USA Real Estate Dataset's extensive data ensures the trained models are robust and reflective of the real estate market's nuances.

When using this code, it's essential to have access to the "USA Real Estate Dataset". Ensure the dataset is well-structured and consistent to avoid data-related issues during processing and analysis.
